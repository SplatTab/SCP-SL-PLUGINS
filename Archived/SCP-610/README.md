# SCP-610
Adds playable SCP 610 using zombie as base at the beggining of the game if a player is scp 096 there is a change he will instead become SCP-610 which acts as a way to nerf 096 without changing 096 himself as SCP-610 is still very OP but requires skill and can be easily contained!

## Features:
SCP-610 has two variants!

> SCP 610-A The main scp Stats:600HP
> SCP 610-B Others infected Stats:100HP 50AP

While being low health on both variants there can easily be tons of them to contain as it spreads like a computer worm! For more info you can also visit the SCP Wiki and read up on SCP-610: https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-610

### Note: this is my first ever plugin so if you find any issues please tell me I finally tested the plugin with 2 players and fixed any issues plugin should be fine now this is final release besides for glitch fixes
